**Machine Learning Model**:

- We've created a `TranscriptionModel` class that uses the AI SDK to simulate a machine learning model.
- The model can be "trained" with user feedback, improving its accuracy over time.
- When the model has enough data (100 entries in this example), it simulates a fine-tuning process.



**Improved Grammatical Structures**:

- We've added handling for Bangla postpositions, mapping them to their Hindi equivalents.
- We've included basic verb conjugation handling, which can be expanded for more comprehensive coverage.



**Feedback Mechanism**:

- Users can now provide feedback on the transcription by entering a corrected version.
- This feedback is used to "train" the machine learning model, potentially improving future transcriptions.



**Integration of ML and Rule-based Approaches**:

- The `transliterateBanglaToHindi` function now uses both rule-based transliteration and the ML model.
- If the ML model fails (e.g., due to API issues), it falls back to the rule-based approach.



**UI Improvements**:

- Added an alert to encourage users to provide feedback.
- Included a textarea for users to enter corrected transcriptions.
