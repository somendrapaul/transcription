1. **Advanced NLP Class**:

1. I've created an `AdvancedNLP` class that uses the AI SDK to perform more complex language processing tasks.
2. It includes methods for analyzing sentence structure, translating idioms, and handling complex grammatical structures.



2. **Improved Grammatical Structures**:

1. I've added handling for more complex grammatical rules, such as conditional sentences, time-based clauses, and cause-effect relationships.
2. The system now considers tense and mood when translating sentences.



3. **Idiom Handling**:

1. I've added a dictionary of common Bangla idioms and their Hindi equivalents.
2. For idioms not in the dictionary, we use the AI SDK to attempt a context-aware translation.



4. **Sentence-Level Processing**:

1. The transliteration process now splits the input into sentences and processes each sentence individually.
2. Complex sentences (those containing certain keywords or structures) are processed using the advanced NLP techniques.



5. **UI Improvements**:

1. Added a switch to toggle the use of advanced NLP techniques.
2. Included a new tab for specifically translating idioms.



6. **Integration of Rule-Based and ML Approaches**:

1. The system now uses a combination of rule-based transliteration, advanced NLP techniques, and machine learning refinement.





These enhancements should significantly improve the accuracy of the transcriptions, especially for complex sentences and idiomatic expressions. The system is now better equipped to handle the nuances of language translation between Bangla and Hindi.

However, please note:

1. The AI SDK usage in this implementation is quite heavy and may incur significant costs or hit rate limits in a production environment. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to optimize these calls, possibly by batching requests or caching common results.
2. The system's accuracy heavily depends on the quality of the AI model's responses. Regular monitoring and fine-tuning would be necessary to maintain high accuracy.
3.  AI model has been trained on both Bangla and Hindi languages. If this is not the case, you may need to provide more context or examples in the prompts.
4. For production use, you'd want to implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for when the AI service is unavailable or returns unexpected results.
5. The grammatical rules and idiom translations are still relatively limited. A more comprehensive solution would require an extensive database of rules and expressions.
